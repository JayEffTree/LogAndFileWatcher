# LogAndFileWatcher

LogAndFileWatcher is a project that I use to log out my NGINX `access.log` entries to a Discord webhook, this also watches for ShareX file uploads and does the Discord webhook as well. I update this sometimes because I like to keep track of what I'm doing inside of the project so I don't mess anything up lmao.

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://npmjs.org/) to install LogAndFileWatcher from the `package.json` 

```bash
npm i
```

## Usage

Rename the `config.json.example` file to `config.json` and setup the file based off the example provided
